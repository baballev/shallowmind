Enjoy it!

### Composition
To run this project, 3 files are mandatory:

- The notebook "Notebook_Project_Shallowmind.ipynb" where all the code is provided. More specific information related to the code itself is provided in the notebook.
- The data "data.zip" where all the data needed are provided. Don't forget to unzip it.
- A model "saved_unet512_b1". This file contains the parameters of a model we've trained and that can be used later to save time.

### Usage
All the required libraries are given in the notebook.
This notebook can be run either on your PC if a GPU is available or it can be run online via Google Colab and Google Drive. Both implementations are provided in the notebook.
